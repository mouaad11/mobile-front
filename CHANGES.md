# Changes Made to Fix Errors in appMoviesFrontend

## 1. Fixed Font Loading in _layout.tsx

The font loading implementation in `_layout.tsx` was not correctly handling the loading state and potential errors. The following changes were made:

- Added proper handling of the return values from `useFonts` hook
- Added a loading state to prevent rendering the app before fonts are loaded
- Added error handling for font loading failures
- Integrated with SplashScreen to show a splash screen during font loading
- Added proper cleanup with useEffect

## 2. Created Missing Watchlists Screen

The application was navigating to a non-existent `/watchlists` route from the home screen. Created a new `watchlists.tsx` file with:

- A complete implementation of the watchlists screen
- Proper UI components for displaying watchlists
- API integration for fetching watchlists
- Navigation back to the home screen
- Placeholder functionality for creating new watchlists

## 3. Converted Colors.jsx to TypeScript

For better type safety and consistency with the rest of the TypeScript project:

- Created a new `Colors.ts` file with the same color constants
- Added TypeScript's `as const` assertion for better type inference
- Kept the same export structure to maintain compatibility with existing imports

## 4. Summary of Files Modified

1. `app/_layout.tsx` - Fixed font loading implementation
2. `app/watchlists.tsx` - Created new file for watchlists screen
3. `constant/Colors.ts` - Created TypeScript version of Colors

These changes ensure that:
- The application loads fonts correctly
- All navigation routes work properly
- The codebase is consistent with TypeScript best practices
